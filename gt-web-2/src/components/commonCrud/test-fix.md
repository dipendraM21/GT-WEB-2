# Runtime Error Fix

## Problem

The error was: `tableCrudActions(...) is not a function`

## Root Cause

The `tableCrudActions` and `formCrudActions` functions return objects, but the code was trying to call them as functions again.

## Fix Applied

### Before (Incorrect):

```typescript
const action = tableCrudActions(apiName)("get");
const action = formCrudActions(apiName)("fetch");
```

### After (Correct):

```typescript
const action = tableCrudActions(apiName).get;
const action = formCrudActions(apiName).fetch;
```

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/commonCrud/CommonHandler.ts` - Fixed function calls
2. `src/components/commonCrud/createCommonCrud.ts` - Added state getter

## Testing

The CouponList component should now work without the runtime error. The TypeScript linter errors are mostly about type safety and don't affect runtime functionality.

## Next Steps

1. Test the CouponList component
2. If it works, address the remaining TypeScript linter errors
3. Consider using a proper state management library like Zustand or Redux Toolkit
